### Error messages for the DeterminismChecker
ordernondet.on.noncollection=@OrderNonDet annotation is invalid for non-collections

TODO: The below error message is confusing.  It will be printed as "@NonDet
must be a subtype of @Det".  That cannot be true, because the type
hierarchy is built into the Determinism Checker.  What you really want to
say is that the element type must be a subtype of the collection type.
(You could mention the specific types as well, but parenthesized, not as
the main text.)
I would also use "element.type" rather than "parameter.type", since it is
more specific and "parameter" usually means "formal parameter".  If you
mean "type parameter", you need to say that explicitly.
You should improve the array access message, too.

invalid.parameter.type=%s must be a subtype of %s
invalid.array.access=%s must be a subtype of %s
